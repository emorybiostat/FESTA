    <P>This section describes the <A HREF="#input">input files</A> and <A HREF="#output">output files</A> for FESTA. It also includes small examples for all types of files associated with FESTA.

    FESTA uses four kind of input files, viz., the linkage disequilibrium file,  the map file, the frequency file and the include/exclude file.
    The LD file is required for the functioning of the algorithm, whereas the other three files can be used to tailor the algorithm. A sample of each of the four kinds of 
    files is given below, to illustrate the format of the files.<BR/>
    The input files for FESTA are generated using <A HREF="http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/fugue">FUGUE</A>. <A HREF="http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/fugue">FUGUE</A> can be 
    used to generate the LD file along with the map and frequency files.

    <TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="95%">
    <B>Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) file:</B> This file contains the pairwise LD parameter between all the SNPs (markers) in the region. Therefore, a line in the LD file must
    contain the names of the SNPs along with the LD between the pair of markers. If a pair is not present in this LD file, it is assumed that they are not in LD, i.e. the r&sup2; 
    parameter between them is 0. The first few lines of a small sample file are given below. The '--cols' switch can be used to tell the program which columns in the input LD file
    contain the information, viz. the marker names and the LD value. <BR/>
    <I>NOTE: <BR/>1. We use the r&sup2; value for the Linkage Disequilibrium information, but the user can use any measure, such as D', etc.<BR/>2. The first line of the LD file must
    not contain any information. It should be a header line.</I>

    <B>Map (Physical Position) file:</B> This file contains a map (physical position) of the SNPs described by the LD file. It may also contain other SNPs not present in the LD file. A single line in the
    map file contains three whitespace seperated columns; (i) the first column contains the chromosome number/name, (ii) the second column contains the SNP name, and (iii) the third
    column contains the position of the SNP in the region (given in kb or in bases). Again, the first few lines of a sample map file are reproduced below.

    FESTA has one primary output file, which contains a summary of the operation and output of the algorithm. In addition to the result file, FESTA can be configured to output two
    other kind of files, viz., the Connection Information file and the 'Criterion tagSNP set' file, which contains the names of the markers in one possible solution that has been
    obtained by optimizing a criterion. In this section, we will take a look at the output files produced by FESTA.

    <TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="95%">
    <B>Result file:</B> The result file comes in different flavors/formats depending on how FESTA was configured. I may contain only the greedy results or it may contain both
    greedy and greedy-exhaustive tagSNP picking results. In addition, it may also contain the physical sizes of the precincts, the size of the double covers, etc. It will also
    include a summary of the results at the end of the file. Three sample output result files are attached below, along with an explanation.
    <P>
    The following result file contains only the greedy results of the FESTA algorithm.
